# Flames Game in Java

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a simple Flames game implemented in Java. Flames is a popular game that predicts the relationship between two individuals based on their names. The acronym "FLAMES" stands for Friendship, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enmity, and Sibling. 

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: The game provides a simple and interactive command-line interface for users to input their names and get the relationship prediction.

- **Name Input Validation**: The code includes validation to ensure that only valid names (containing alphabets) are accepted as input.

- **FLAMES Algorithm**: The core of the game is the FLAMES algorithm, which calculates the relationship prediction based on the characters in the input names.
